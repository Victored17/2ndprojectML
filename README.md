Before we begin:
I'm a trainee to machine learning and data science. This is my second project, and I'm using the customer dataset, which is the one of most popular dataset on Kaggle. I appreciate your feedback on anything in this notebook to help me improve my code and get the best possible results.

The firsts steps is to define the problem we want to solve. In this case,we want build a model to classified all customers into 4 segments.
